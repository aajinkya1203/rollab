# rollab

A new era of communicating!

A platform to communicate with your friends in realtime, while at the same time challenging them to an online game. No friends online? Don't worry, we got you! You can go against a bot too or even chat with the rollab assistant without any of your chats getting stored ever with the bot!

_Need to have a group discussion / gossip / share some tea with your friends? Create a group, invite and go on without the chats ever getting stored!_

_Need to write something really important but need it to get stored? Personally message the friend!_
